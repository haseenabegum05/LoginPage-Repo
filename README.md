# LoginPage-Repo
A login page is a fundamental component of many websites and applications, serving as the initial point of access for users. Its primary purpose is to authenticate and authorize individuals, granting them access to specific content, features, or functionality that may not be available to unauthenticated users
1. Header/Logo: At the top of the login page, you often find the platform's logo or branding, establishing visual recognition and trust with users.

2. Username/Email Field: Users are required to input their username or email address into a designated text field. This information is used to uniquely identify the user.

3. Password Field: A secure password field allows users to input their confidential password. For security purposes, passwords are usually masked, displaying dots or asterisks instead of the actual characters.

4.  Sign Up/Register Link: For new users, a "Sign Up" or "Register" link is often available. Clicking this link redirects them to the registration page where they can create a new account.
